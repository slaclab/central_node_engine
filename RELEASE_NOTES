  * Adjust RT priorities of all the evaluation threads as described in this
    table (note that the NIC kernel thread priorities are not set as part of
    this repository, but instead on the CPU startup script):
    | Thread               | Priority |
    |----------------------|----------|
    | NIC (kernel)         |    80    |
    | CPSW: UDP            |    81    |
    | CPSW: RSSI           |    82    |
    | CPSW: Depack         |    83    |
    | CPSW: TDESTMux       |    84    |
    | Engine: FwReader     |    85    |
    | Engine: InputUpdates |    86    |
    | Engine: HeartBeat    |    87    |
    | Engine: MitWriter    |    87    |
    | Engine: EngineThread |    88    |
  * Add a thread-safe `Queue` class.
  * Migrate the update input and the mitigation shared buffers to a `Queue`
    object. This will give the system more elasticity to absorb delays between
    threads, instead of blocking the whole pipeline.
  * heartbeat: modify the `NonBlocking` policy class to keep a request counter,
    instead of a flag, in order to avoid blocking the requesting thread in case
    the previous heartbeat takes longer than `2.7ms` to write the FW register.
  * Bug fix on central_node_database: inputProcessed() should lock the `mutex` and
    notify using the `condition_variable`.
  * Add name to the `fwPCChangeThread` thread.
  * Fix format on some source files to improve readability.

central_node_engine-R1-8-0:
  * Implement power class change asynchronous notification message
    handler.
  * Fix bugs the HeartBeat class, which was generating long periods
    between heartbeats.
  * Fix bugs and improve the CN engine.

central_node_engine-R1-7-0:
  * Update buildroot to version 2019.08.
  * Update CPSW to version R4.4.1. This implied update boost to version
    1.64.0 and yaml-cpp to version yaml-cpp-0.5.3_boost-1.64.0.
  * Fix all compilation warnings.
  * Merge changes from the EIC branch.

central_node_engine-R1-6-0-eic:
  * Changed logic to allow AOM
  * Bug fixed on the FW configuration with AOM bypassed - wrong
    bits were being changed

 central_node_engine-R1-5-0-eic:
  * Change to support AOM enable while mechanical laser shutter
    is closed (works with mps_configuration EIC branch and
    central_node_ioc branches)

central_node_engine-R1-4-1:
  * Change to how the charge integration time is written to FW.
    The value is broken up into bits 0:9 and 16:25.

central_node_engine-R1-4-0:
  * Compatible with mps_database-R1-1-0, which has a change in the
    crates.number to crates.crate_id. This required code changes
    in this library.

central_node_engine-R1-3-3:
  * Implemented bypass for fast digital devices (they must have
    a single device input). The firmware configuration is reloaded
    when a fast digital input bypass is created or expires.

central_node_engine-R1-3-2:
  * Addition of functionality to allow forcing a power class to
    o beam destination (e.g. allow ops to shut off gun by setting
    a PV).
  * Addition of missing firmware call to run central node stand-alone,
    without connecting to central node card.

central_node_engine-R1-3-1:
  * Change introduced in R1-2-5 stops MPS whenever the update thread
    is stopped/started. Modified so it doesn't start MPS only after
    loading a configuration the first time.

central_node_engine-R1-3-0:
  * Addition of Firmware::beamFaultClear(), for clearing
    faults caused by power class or charge violation

central_node_engine-R1-2-5:
  * After config is loaded MPS is not enabled by default, user
    must enable it on the EDM panel

central_node_engine-R1-2-4:
  * Minor fix on the beam charge table readback - changed from 16 to 32 bits

central_node_engine-R1-2-3:
  * Restored loading beam charge table using database values
